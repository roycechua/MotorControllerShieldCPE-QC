## MotorControllerShieldCPE-QC
This is a library for the L293D motor controller shield based on AFMotor.h library customized for the Robotics Workshop of the Computer Engineering Department of TIP-QC.

You can read here or go to the web page [roycechua.me/MotorControllerShieldCPE-QC/](http://roycechua.me/MotorControllerShieldCPE-QC/) 

### Instructions

To use this library you must 

1. Download AFMotor.h library from Adafruit wbich you can conveniently download on the Arduino IDE by clicking **Sketch** then **Include Libaries**

3. Clone this repository or Download as ZIP, if you cloned this repository make sure to move it to the Arduino library location (ex. _C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\Arduino\libraries_ for Windows) OR if you downloaded this repository as a ZIP file, extract it then move it to the Arduino library location.

The two libraries should be present in the Arduino library folder like the one below.

4. MotorControllerShieldCPE-QC library's example should now be present in the Arduino IDE through File -> Examples -> MotorControllerShieldCPE-QC. You should be able to see 3 examples.

Remember to create an instance of Controller.
```C++
Controller bot = Controller();
```

For robot navigation, these are the functions available
```C
bot.moveForward(speedmotorA, speedMotorB) // from 0-255
bot.moveBackward(speedmotorA, speedMotorB) // from 0-255
bot.moveLeft(speedmotorA, speedMotorB) // from 0-255
bot.moveRight(speedmotorA, speedMotorB) // from 0-255
```
